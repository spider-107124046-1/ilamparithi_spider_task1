# Example Monorepo

This is a sample monorepo for testing the Vault Sweeper script.

This is the state of it AFTER the first execution, so there will be no unsafe lines. Permisions will also not be set if you just clone it from this repo.

If you want a simulated setup, run `generate_example_monorepo.sh`, NOT on an NTFS/FAT32/exFAT filesystem (some linux filesystem features won't be available on them).
